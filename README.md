    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        print(f"GPU Memory: {torch.cuda.memory_allocated(0) / 1024**3:.2f}GB")
        print(f"GPU Utilization: {GPUtil.getGPUs()[0].load * 100:.1f}%")
Performance Profiling
pythonwith torch.profiler.profile() as prof:
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
print(prof.key_averages().table())

🚨 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
GPU Memory Error
bashRuntimeError: CUDA out of memory
Solutions:

Reduce max_tokens parameter
Enable 4-bit quantization
Clear GPU cache: torch.cuda.empty_cache()

Model Loading Timeout
bashConnection timeout during model download
Solutions:

Check internet connection
Use Hugging Face token for authenticated access
Increase timeout in requests

Performance Issues
bashSlow response times (>5 seconds)
Solutions:

Verify GPU is being used: nvidia-smi
Check CUDA installation: torch.cuda.is_available()
Enable torch.compile optimization
